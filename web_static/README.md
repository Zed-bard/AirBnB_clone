# 0x01. AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Background Context

In this project, the goal is to breathe life into the AirBnB clone by developing its front end step-by-step. Before diving into a complex web application, the first phase involves designing, sketching, and prototyping each element:

1. Create simple HTML static pages.
2. Develop a style guide.
3. Populate pages with fake contents.
4. No Javascript involved.
5. No data loaded from external sources.

This project is an opportunity to gain proficiency in manipulating HTML and CSS languages. HTML provides the structure of the page, serving as the foundation, while CSS handles the styling and design. It is essential to establish a solid HTML structure before initiating the styling process, as structure precedes design.
